📍 About the Project
This project is a Basic Network Sniffer developed using Python and the Scapy library. It was built as part of my internship at CodeAlpha, focusing on real-time packet capture and analysis. The tool is capable of inspecting network traffic, identifying key protocol information, and displaying detailed insights about captured packets.
The project demonstrates foundational knowledge in network security, protocol analysis, and low-level packet inspection—skills that are crucial in cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
🚀 Key Features
📡 Live Packet Capture
Monitors and captures packets on the active network interface in real time.
🔍 Protocol Analysis
Identifies and parses common protocols such as IP, TCP, and UDP.
📬 Source & Destination Details
Extracts source and destination IP addresses and port numbers.
🧾 Payload Inspection
Attempts to decode and display packet payload content.
⚠️ Disclaimer
This tool is intended strictly for educational and ethical purposes. Unauthorized interception of network traffic may violate privacy laws and institutional policies. Only use on networks you own or have explicit permission to monitor.
