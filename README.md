📍 About the Project
This repository contains a Basic Network Sniffer developed in Python using the Scapy library, alongside a Security Awareness Presentation focused on Social Engineering Tactics. Both were completed as part of my internship with CodeAlpha, where I explored core concepts in network security, packet analysis, and user-focused cybersecurity education.
The network sniffer captures real-time traffic on a local network interface, decoding protocols and payloads to help understand how data flows through a network. The presentation complements this technical tool by educating users on how attackers exploit human behavior through phishing emails and fake websites.

🚀 Key Features (Network Sniffer)
📡 Live Packet Capture
Captures network packets in real time using Scapy.
🔍 Protocol Analysis
Detects and inspects IP, TCP, UDP headers, and raw payloads.
📬 Source & Destination Insight
Displays source/destination IPs and port numbers.
🧾 Payload Decoding
Attempts to decode and print readable payload data.

🛡️ Social Engineering Awareness
As part of this internship, I also developed a presentation on Social Engineering to raise awareness about common attacker techniques such as:
Phishing emails
Fake websites
Pretexting and baiting
Real-world case studies
Interactive quizzes and best practices to stay safe
This portion of the project helps bridge technical skills with user education, a key focus in cybersecurity defense strategies.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This network tool is strictly intended for educational and ethical use only. Capturing packets without authorization on networks you do not own may violate laws and policies. Always seek permission before using such tools.
